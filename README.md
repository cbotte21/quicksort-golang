# quicksort-golang

My attempt at an optimized implementation of quicksort. This is an adaptive algorith which resorts to insertionsort when a slice is under a specific length. Also gets pivor from a median of three partition.

The project includes a test case which compares equality between 1000 arrays sorted using quicksort and insertion sort. Each array contains 50 integers ranging from 0-2500.
